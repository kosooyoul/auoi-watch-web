## Risk Analysis

### High-Impact Risks

**1. B2B Sales Cycle Too Long**
- **Risk:** 6-12 months to close enterprise deals → cash flow issues
- **Probability:** High (60%)
- **Impact:** High (delays revenue)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with SMB (1-week sales cycle)
  - Offer free trials (reduce decision friction)
  - Focus on B2C revenue during B2B ramp-up

**2. Hardware Compatibility Issues**
- **Risk:** App doesn't work on Samsung TVs, cheap Android boxes, etc.
- **Probability:** Medium (40%)
- **Impact:** High (deal breakers)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on 10+ device types before launch
  - Partner with hardware vendors (Raspberry Pi)
  - Offer tested hardware bundles (Pi + monitor = $200)

**3. High Support Burden**
- **Risk:** B2B customers expect 24/7 support, fast responses
- **Probability:** High (70%)
- **Impact:** Medium (costs)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build robust monitoring/alerting (proactive)
  - Comprehensive help docs (self-service)
  - Hire part-time support agent (Month 12+)
  - Set clear SLA expectations (24h response, not instant)

**4. Customization Creep**
- **Risk:** Customers request custom features → dev time explodes
- **Probability:** High (80%)
- **Impact:** Medium (delays roadmap)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict scope in contracts ("as-is" software)
  - Enterprise plan for custom work (extra $5K+)
  - Roadmap voting (customers vote on features)
  - "No" is an option (protect core product)

### Medium-Impact Risks

**5. Competitors Copy Model**
- **Risk:** FlipClock or Yodeck adds similar features
- **Probability:** Medium (50% within 12 months)
- **Impact:** Medium (market share loss)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Speed to market (launch fast)
  - Lock in customers (annual contracts, 20% discount)
  - Continuous innovation (new themes, features)
  - Build brand loyalty (community, content)

**6. Low Renewal Rates**
- **Risk:** Customers churn after 3-6 months
- **Probability:** Medium (40% churn is common for <$50/mo SaaS)
- **Impact:** High (kills recurring revenue model)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Over-deliver on value (new themes monthly)
  - Proactive support (check-in calls)
  - Loyalty incentives (Month 12 = 1 month free)
  - Annual plans (prepay discount)

**7. Payment Collection Issues**
- **Risk:** B2B customers delay payment, dispute charges
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (20%)
- **Impact:** Medium (cash flow)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Prepaid model (charge upfront monthly)
  - Auto-shutoff after 7 days non-payment

1. Launch B2C (ProductHunt, marketing)
2. Monitor B2B interest signals (user requests, inquiries)
3. Create B2B waitlist (gauge demand)

**Medium-term (Month 7-12):**
1. Review B2C results (conversion, revenue, feedback)
2. Decide: Proceed with B2B pilot? (yes/no decision gate)
3. If yes: Develop signage features (120 hours)
4. If no: Double-down on B2C optimization

**This approach minimizes risk while keeping B2B option open.**
