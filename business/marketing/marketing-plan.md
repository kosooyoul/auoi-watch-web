     Hi Product Hunt! 👋

     Ring Time Clock is different:
     - Beautiful ring-based time visualization (HH/MM/SS/MS)
     - 5 gorgeous themes (+ 9 premium themes launching soon!)
     - PWA support (install as app, works offline)
     - URL theme sharing (share your favorite theme with friends)

     We're launching premium theme packs today ($3.99-$4.99). Early bird
     discount: 30% off for the first 100 buyers!

   - Be transparent (clearly state "I'm the creator")
   - No spamming (1 post per subreddit, max 3 per week)

2. **Post Formats That Work**

   **Format A: "Show & Tell" (Best for r/SideProject, r/webdev)**
   ```
   Title: "I built a minimalist web clock with PWA support - feedback welcome!"

   Body:
   Hey r/webdev! I spent the last 3 months building a minimalist clock app
   using Vanilla JS + SVG animations. It's a PWA so you can install it as
   an app and use it offline.

   Features:
   - Ring-based time visualization (HH/MM/SS/MS)
   - 5 themes (+ premium theme packs launching soon)
   - URL theme sharing (share your favorite theme)
   - PWA support (works offline)

   Tech stack: Vanilla JS, SVG, CSS3, Service Workers

   Would love feedback! What features would make this useful for you?

   Try it: [link]

   (Mods: let me know if this breaks rules - happy to remove!)
   ```

   **Format B: "Value Post" (Best for r/productivity)**
   ```
   Title: "5 Minimalist Productivity Tools That Changed My WFH Setup"

   Body:
   I've been remote for 3 years and these tools keep me sane:

   1. Notion (task management)
   2. Forest (focus timer)
   3. Ring Time Clock (aesthetic clock - I built this!)
   4. Noisli (ambient sounds)
   5. Toggl (time tracking)

   What are your must-have tools?

   [Subtle mention, not aggressive promotion]
   ```

   **Format C: "Ask for Feedback" (Best for r/Design)**
   ```
   Title: "Designed a ring-based clock visualization - thoughts?"

   Body:
   [Image/GIF of ring animation]

   I'm working on a minimalist clock app and designed this ring-based
   time display. Each ring represents Hours/Minutes/Seconds/Milliseconds.

   Does this feel intuitive? Too abstract? Would love design critique!

### Channel 4: Viral Loop (URL Theme Sharing)

**Why Viral Loops Work:**
- Dropbox: +60% growth through referrals
- Hotmail: 12M users in 18 months (viral signature)
- Our advantage: URL theme sharing already built (v1.5.0)

**Current State:**
- ✅ Users can share themes via URL (e.g., ?theme=ocean)
- ❌ No tracking (who shared, who clicked)
- ❌ No incentive (why should users share?)

**Viral Loop Optimization Plan:**

**Stage 1: Track & Measure (Month 1)**

1. **Add Referral Tracking**
   - URL format: `?theme=ocean&ref=user_id`
   - Track: Who shared, how many clicks, conversions
   - Store in analytics (Google Analytics or Plausible)

2. **Measure Baseline**
   - Current sharing rate: X% of users share themes
   - Conversion rate: Y% of referred users become paying customers
   - K-factor: (X% × Y%) = organic viral coefficient

**Stage 2: Optimize for Virality (Month 2-3)**

3. **Make Sharing Frictionless**
   - Add "Share Theme" button (prominent, easy to find)
   - Pre-populate share message:
     ```
     "Check out this beautiful clock theme I'm using! 🕐✨
     [Preview image]
     Try it: [URL with ref code]"
     ```
   - One-click sharing: Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Email, Copy link

4. **Add Social Proof**
   - "12,453 people are using Ring Time Clock"
   - "This theme has been shared 234 times"
   - Show theme popularity rankings

**Stage 3: Incentivize Sharing (Month 4-6)**

5. **Referral Rewards**
   - **Sharer gets:** 1 free premium theme for every 5 friends who sign up
   - **Referee gets:** 15% off first purchase (if they click referral link)
   - **Both win:** Classic double-sided incentive (Dropbox model)

6. **Gamification**
   - "Theme Creator" badge (share 10+ themes)
   - Leaderboard: "Top Theme Sharers" (public recognition)
   - Unlock exclusive themes at milestones (50 shares = secret theme)

**Viral Loop Metrics:**

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Sharing Rate** | (Sharers ÷ Total Users) × 100 | 10-15% |
| **Click-Through Rate** | (Clicks ÷ Shares) × 100 | 20-30% |
| **Conversion Rate** | (Signups ÷ Clicks) × 100 | 30-40% |
| **K-Factor** | (Sharing Rate × CTR × Conversion) | 0.3-0.5 |

**Goal:** K-factor of 0.3-0.5 = each user brings 0.3-0.5 new users (30-50% organic growth)

**Success Metrics:**
- 15% of users share themes (Month 6)
- 500 referral signups (Month 6)
- 50 referral purchases (Month 6, ~$200 revenue)

- Build backlinks (guest posts, directory submissions)

**Contingency:**
- Paid ads test (if CAC <$1)
- Influencer partnerships (faster traffic)

---

### Risk 3: Viral Loop Doesn't Work (K-Factor <0.1)

**Mitigation:**
- Make sharing frictionless (one-click)
- Test different incentives (referral rewards)
- A/B test messaging ("Share theme" vs "Invite friends")

**Contingency:**
- Focus on other channels (SEO, Reddit)
- Viral loop is bonus, not core strategy
