- Lifetime access: $36-$99
- B2B plans: $10-$20/user/month
- **Our positioning:** $3.99-$4.99 (affordable, one-time)

### Conversion Benchmarks

- Self-serve SaaS: 3-5%
- Top performers (Spotify, Slack): 30%+
- **Our target:** 3-5% (conservative, achievable)

### Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1: B2C First (Month 1-6)** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Launch premium themes
- Build user base & social proof
- Generate initial revenue
- **Decision Gate at Month 6:** Review B2C results → B2B yes/no

**Phase 2: B2B Pilot (Month 7-12)** ⏳ CONDITIONAL
- Develop signage features (120 hours)
- Target 5-10 pilot customers
- Validate B2B model
- **Only if:** B2C conversion >3%, revenue >$2K, user demand signals

**Phase 3: B2B Scale (Month 13-24)** ⏳ CONDITIONAL
- Hire sales rep
- Grow to 50 customers
- Target $5K MRR
- **Only if:** Pilot succeeds (<10% churn, profitable)

**Phase 4: Enterprise (Month 25+)** ⏳ CONDITIONAL
- Target chains & transit
- 2-3 large deals
- $100K+ ARR
- **Only if:** SMB B2B profitable

### Risks & Mitigation

**Risks:**
- Long sales cycle (6-12 months) → Start B2C first
- Hardware compatibility → Test 10+ devices early
- High support burden → Clear SLA/scope in contracts
- Customization creep → Charge extra for custom work

### Documentation

**Complete B2B strategy available:**
- `business/strategy/b2b-signage-model.md` (50+ pages)

  - Risk analysis
  - Revenue projections

### Decision Framework

**✅ Proceed with B2B if (Month 6 review):**
- B2C conversion >3%
- B2C revenue >$2,000
- 5+ users request B2B features
- Have runway for 120h dev
- Can invest 3-6 months

**⛔ Do NOT pursue B2B if:**
- B2C conversion <2%
- No B2C revenue
- No bandwidth
- No runway
- Support already struggling

### Next Steps

**Immediate (This Week):**
- Review B2B strategy document
- Decide: B2C-only or Hybrid path?
- Set B2C launch date (Month 1-6 priority)

**Month 6 (Decision Gate):**
- Review B2C metrics (conversion, revenue, feedback)

**Month 7-12 (If B2B Approved):**
- Develop signage features
- Launch B2B pilot (5-10 customers)
- Validate model

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Business Case:** Strong ✅
- Market gap identified (premium themes B2C + signage B2B)
- Revenue potential validated:
  - B2C only: $15K/year (conservative)
  - Hybrid: $101K/year (3x higher by Year 3)
- Low investment required:
  - B2C: $650 marketing + 30h dev
  - B2B: +$120h dev (only if B2C succeeds)
- High ROI potential (2,207% for B2C, 31x for hybrid)

**Readiness:** Planning Complete, Two Paths Available ⏳
- **Path 1 (B2C Only):** Ready now (30h dev, 4-6 weeks)
- **Path 2 (Hybrid):** B2C now, B2B later (decision gate Month 6)
- All strategic work done (research, strategy, marketing + B2B option)
- Waiting for PM/Developer decision

**Recommendation:** ✅ Hybrid Strategy (B2C First → B2B If Validated)
- **Short-term (Month 1-6):** Launch B2C premium themes
  - Fastest path to revenue (30 hours development)
  - Validated business model (proven freemium conversion)
  - Marketing plan ready (can execute immediately)
  - Risk: Low (small investment, high upside)
- **Long-term (Month 7+):** Add B2B signage IF B2C succeeds
  - 3x revenue potential by Year 3 ($101K vs $15K)
  - Requires 120h development + sales effort
  - Conditional on B2C validation (conversion >3%, revenue >$2K)
  - Risk: Medium (higher investment, slower revenue)

**Strategic Advantage:** Flexibility
- Can start with low-risk B2C
- Can add high-revenue B2B later
- Decision gate at Month 6 (data-driven)
- No commitment to B2B until proven

**Next Decision Points:**
1. **Now:** Approve B2C implementation (30 hours)
2. **Month 6:** Review B2C results → B2B yes/no
3. **Month 12:** Review B2B pilot → scale yes/no
