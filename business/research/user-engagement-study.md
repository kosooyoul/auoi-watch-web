## Part 1: User Pain Points (What Frustrates Users)

### From User Reviews Analysis

- [Clockology Reviews](https://justuseapp.com/en/app/1456386228/clockology/reviews)

### Top Complaints

**1. Unreliable Alarms** 🚨
> "Alarms have not been working reliably since an update, causing users to oversleep and miss work."

**Insight:** Trust is paramount. If a clock app fails once, users abandon it forever.

**2. Too Many Unnecessary Features**
> "Too many configuration options confusing for beginners."

**Insight:** Feature bloat kills simplicity. Users want fast, obvious controls.

**3. Annoying UI Patterns**
> "The app automatically expands the options panel when changing an alarm, which users find very annoying."

**Insight:** Small UX friction compounds into frustration. Respect user flow.

**4. Lost Progress / No Auto-Save**
> "The app crashes while making watch faces, causing lost progress without auto-save."

**Insight:** Users hate losing work. Auto-save is non-negotiable for customization.

**5. Unclear Time Tracking**
> "Time not tracking accurately, schedules not showing, lack of live updates."

**Insight:** Clarity and accuracy are table stakes. If users question the time, they leave.
